# antifa-witches
A TTRPG about a coven of witches who are fighting fascism

NatziCon 2020 is coming to your town.
Of course that's not what they call it.  They've got some bullshit name like "unite the right" or "Trump rally"
But fuck that noise.  You've seen this shit before and you know what it is: another fucking NatziCon.

One: You're a witch.  You do magic and other queer stuff.
Two: You're willing to oppose Fascism by any means necessary
