# antifa-witches
A TTRPG about a coven of witches who are fighting fascism

# THE GAME
You just found out NatziCon 2020 is coming to your town.  
Of course that's not what they call it.  They've got some bullshit name like "Unite the Right" "Free Speech Week" or "Trump Campaign Rally".  
But fuck that.  You've seen this shit before and you know what it is: another fucking NatziCon.  

One: You're a witch.  You do magic and other queer stuff.  
Two: You're willing to oppose fascism by any means necessary.    

# CHARACTER CREATION
Roll 3D6 to determine your Descriptor, your Motivation, and your Preferred Praxis  

## DESCRIPTOR
1. Punk  
2. Goth  
3. Hippy  
4. Nerd  
5. Queen  
6. Bear  

## MOTIVATION
1. Idealist  
2. Rebel  
3. Leader  
4. Healer   
5. Organizer   
6. Protector


## PREFERRED PRAXIS
1. Making beautiful art / Making provocative art
2. Non-violent direct action / Violent direct action
3. Journalism, truth telling & education / Espianoge & deplatforming
4. Community building and outreach / Mass protest and general strike
5. Benevolent witchcraft / Malevolent witchcraft
6. Blogging / Hacktivism

Preferred Tactics come in pairs.  
If **witch** is greater than 3 use the one on the left as your Preferred Praxis.  
If **antifa** is greater than 3 use the one on the right as your Preferred Praxis.  
If they're both 3, you choose.  

## STATS
You have two stats. Each starts with 3 points.  
Antifa: Use this stat whenever you're fighting fascism   
Witch: Use this stat to perform magic or whenever you're trying to build something worth fighting for.  

## ACTIONS
When you act, and the outcomeis in doubt, roll a D6.  
If it’s equal to or under the relevant stat, you succeed.  
If it’s over the stat, you fail.  
If you’re using your Preferred Praxis or doing something related to your Motivation, roll 2D6 and pick the lowest.  

# CHANGING STATS
Move one point from **Antifa** to **Witch** When you cite wiccan lore (in rhyme) or whenever you raise an objection to a paticular antifascist tactic.  
Move one point from **Witch** to **Antifa** When you state a truth about how those fuckers are trying to discount, disdain, or criminalize who you are or who you love. Each person that says "fuck those guys" may also move a point from **Witch** to **Antifa**

## THE END
If your **antifa** stat ever reaches 6, you've gone too far.  The feds swoop in.  They accuse you of terrorism and haul you off to jail.  
If your **witch** stat ever reaches 6, you've become soft.  You care more about comfort than justice.  You sell out.
